# Descriptive Statistics - Manual Calculations  

Worksheet demonstrating the manual computation of key descriptive statistics measures for ungrouped and grouped data.

## Summary of Measures  

| **Category**               | **Measure**            | **Purpose**                              | **Use**                                        |  
|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|  
| **Central Tendency**        | Mean                  | Average value of data.                   | Gives an overall picture, but sensitive to outliers. |  
|                             | Median                | Middle value in ordered data.            | Robust center, unaffected by outliers.        |  
|                             | Mode                  | Most frequent value.                     | Highlights trends or common occurrences.      |  
| **Dispersion (Spread)**     | Range                 | Difference between max and min.          | Quick indicator of variability; affected by outliers. |  
|                             | Variance              | Variability around the mean (squared).   | Quantifies data spread from the mean.         |  
|                             | Standard Deviation    | Variability around the mean (linear).    | Average deviation; simpler than variance.     |  
|                             | Interquartile Range   | Spread of the middle 50%.                | Highlights variability while ignoring outliers. |  
|                             | Coefficient of Variation | Relative variability to the mean.     | Compares spread across datasets with different scales. |  
| **Position**                | Quartiles             | Data split into 4 equal parts.           | Shows data distribution and concentration.    |  
|                             | Percentiles           | Data split into 100 equal parts.         | Indicates position relative to the dataset.   |  
|                             | Mean Deviation        | Average absolute deviation from the mean.| Simplified alternative to standard deviation. |  

## Observations  
- **Ungrouped Data**: Calculations focus on individual data points, ideal for small datasets.  
- **Grouped Data**: Assumes data is binned into intervals, requiring midpoint estimations.  
- **Interpolation**: Critical for non-integer positions in quartiles and percentiles.  

## Visualizations   
- **Box Plot**: Highlights quartiles, IQR, and potential outliers.  

## Practical Applications   
- Build foundational knowledge for basic statistics.
